	<!--
		The whole barcode comparison wierdness in the functions below is a
		product of the fact that some barcodes are entered incorrectly in the
		database. If you scan such barcodes, they'll return "00001283", but
		will be entered in the database (and printed on the label) as
		"GMC-00001283"

	<!--
		This function prints summary details on problems with an audit
		for a range. It's only appropriate if we're assuming each
		audit_group in the date range is a discrete container.

		Forgive me for how bad this code is. I did try to make it as
		straight-forward as possible. The root "from" clause is just
		pulling a list of all audit_groups in the provided date range,
		with whatever the majority of the linked database entries think
		is the container. This container becomes the expected container
		for all the subqueries. I really wish I could use a FULL JOIN,
		but postgresql doesn't do FULL JOINs unless they're hashable
		or mergeable (As of Postgresql 9.3), which means the goofy crap
		with the barcodes prevents making this monster slightly more readable.

		This function returns details on the results of a test from
		getReportByDate. It should return a scanned barcode, the barcode
		found in the database, and the container path. If these values
		are null, they're not found. If the container_id doesn't match the
		provided container_id, it was found in the wrong location.

		A sort is done based on the container_id, against the container_id
		specified using a DISTINCT so that if a box exists in multiple locations
		it only shows us the location we specified. The distinct is performed
		against the barcode (or the audit_id) in case there's multiple
		entries in the database for that barcode.
