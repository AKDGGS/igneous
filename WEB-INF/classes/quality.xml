		This file contains all the queries used to render
		reports for the quality assurance report. If the query
		is succesful, it should return no results. Each returned
		row represents a single error.

		For display purposes, all the reports listed here must return
		an "id" field, and a "desc" field. The contents of these fields
		are optional, and merely used to aide the user in tracking down
		the sources of problems. You may populate them with whatever you
		want.

		Each function here must have a corresponding count function, that
		returns the count as a total number of errors returned.

		The queries listed here must corrospond to the reported listed
		in QualityServlet.java found in the source directory.
